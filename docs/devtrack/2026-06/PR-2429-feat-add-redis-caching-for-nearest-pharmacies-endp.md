# PR #2429 — feat: add Redis caching for nearest pharmacies endpoint

> **Merged:** 2026-06-24 | **Author:** @ash1shkumar | **Area:** Backend | **Impact Score:** 9 | **Closes:** #2295

## What Changed

We have implemented Redis caching for the `/api/pharmacies/nearest` endpoint within our backend API. This change introduces a read-through and write-through caching strategy, where our system first attempts to retrieve pharmacy data from Redis before querying Supabase. If data is not found in the cache, it is fetched from the database, formatted, and then stored in Redis with a 1-hour Time-To-Live (TTL) for subsequent requests.

## The Problem Being Solved

The `/api/pharmacies/nearest` endpoint is a critical component for users seeking nearby medical facilities. Prior to this change, every request to this endpoint, regardless of how frequently the same location was queried, resulted in a direct database call to Supabase, either via a PostGIS RPC function or a JavaScript-based Haversine calculation. This led to increased load on our Supabase instance and potentially slower response times for users, especially under high traffic or for frequently searched locations. The absence of caching meant inefficient resource utilization and a bottleneck for scaling this popular feature.

## Files Modified

- `apps/api/src/routes/pharmacies.ts`

## Implementation Details

The core of this change resides within the `router.get("/nearest", ...)` handler in `apps/api/src/routes/pharmacies.ts`.

1.  **Dependencies:** We introduced imports for `redisClient` from `../utils/redis` and the types `FormattedPharmacy`, `PharmacyRpcResult` from `../types/pharmacy.types` to support Redis integration and maintain type safety.

2.  **Parameter Extraction and Rounding:**
    *   The `lat`, `lng`, and `radius` query parameters are extracted after validation by `pharmacyNearestSchema`.
    *   Crucially, `lat` and `lng` are then rounded to 3 decimal places using `toFixed(3)` to create `roundedLat` and `roundedLng`. This decision is made to normalize coordinates for cache key generation, improving the cache hit ratio for slightly varying user locations.

3.  **Cache Key Generation:**
    *   A unique `cacheKey` is constructed using the format `pharmacies:nearest:${roundedLat}:${roundedLng}:${radius}`. This ensures that requests for the same rounded coordinates and radius hit the same cache entry.

4.  **Cache Read (Read-Through Logic):**
    *   Before any database operations, our system attempts to read from Redis.
    *   A `try...catch` block encapsulates the Redis read operation to ensure graceful degradation.
    *   Inside the `try` block, we first check `if (redisClient.isOpen)` to confirm the Redis client is connected.
    *   `const cached = await redisClient.get(cacheKey);` attempts to retrieve the data.
    *   If `cached` data is found, it is `JSON.parse`d and immediately returned to the client via `return res.json(JSON.parse(cached));`, bypassing all subsequent database logic.
    *   If an error occurs during the Redis read (e.g., connection issues), `logger.warn("Redis cache read failed", { error });` logs the incident, and the execution flow continues to the database query path, ensuring the endpoint remains functional.

5.  **Database Query and Formatting:**
    *   If no cached data is found, the system proceeds with the existing logic to fetch pharmacies. This involves either calling the `supabase.rpc("get_nearest_pharmacies", ...)` function (primary path) or performing a JavaScript-based Haversine calculation (fallback path).
    *   The results from either path are then mapped and sliced to produce the `pharmacies` array, formatted as `FormattedPharmacy` objects.

6.  **Cache Write (Write-Through Logic):**
    *   After successfully obtaining and formatting the `pharmacies` data, a `responseData` object `{ pharmacies }` is created.
    *   Another `try...catch` block handles the Redis write operation.
    *   Again, `if (redisClient.isOpen)` is checked.
    *   `await redisClient.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(responseData), { EX: 3600 });` stores the `responseData` in Redis. The `EX: 3600` option sets the expiration time to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
    *   Similar to the read operation, any errors during the Redis write are caught, logged via `logger.warn("Redis cache write failed", { error });`, and the response is still sent to the client, preventing a failure due to caching issues.

7.  **Response:** Finally, `return res.json(responseData);` sends the formatted pharmacy data to the client.

8.  **Minor Refactor:** A small, unrelated change was made in the `router.post` handler for inventory processing. The error mapping for `inventoryRowSchema.safeParse` was updated from `validationResult.error.errors` to `validationResult.error.issues` and the error object was explicitly typed (`e: { message: string }`), reflecting a minor adjustment to how Zod's validation errors are accessed.

## Technical Decisions

1.  **Choice of Redis:** We selected Redis for caching due to its proven performance as an in-memory data store, low latency, and robust feature set, making it ideal for high-read, frequently accessed data like nearest pharmacy locations.
2.  **Read-Through/Write-Through Caching Pattern:** This pattern was chosen to ensure that our system always attempts to serve the fastest possible response from the cache while simultaneously ensuring that the cache is populated with fresh data upon a miss or expiration. This balances performance gains with data freshness.
3.  **Latitude/Longitude Rounding (`toFixed(3)`):** Rounding `lat` and `lng` to 3 decimal places for cache key generation (`pharmacies:nearest:<lat>:<lng>:<radius>`) is a deliberate optimization. While it slightly reduces geographical precision in the cache key itself, it significantly increases the cache hit ratio. A difference of 0.001 degrees in latitude/longitude is approximately 111 meters at the equator, which is an acceptable level of granularity for "nearest pharmacies" queries, especially when a `radius` parameter is also involved. Using full precision would lead to a very sparse cache and minimal performance benefits.
4.  **Cache TTL (3600 seconds / 1 hour):** A 1-hour TTL was chosen as a reasonable balance between data freshness and performance. Pharmacy locations and their operational status typically do not change minute-by-minute, so a 1-hour cache provides substantial performance benefits without serving excessively stale data. This can be adjusted in the future if business requirements for real-time accuracy change.
5.  **Graceful Degradation for Redis Failures:** The inclusion of `try...catch` blocks around all Redis operations, coupled with checks for `redisClient.isOpen`, is a critical design decision. This ensures that if Redis is unavailable or experiences an error, our API endpoint will gracefully fall back to querying the database directly. This prioritizes the availability of the core service over caching benefits, preventing a single point of failure.
6.  **JSON Stringification for Storage:** Storing the `responseData` as a `JSON.stringify`ed string in Redis is standard practice for complex JavaScript objects. This allows for efficient serialization and deserialization while preserving the structure of the pharmacy list.

## How To Re-Implement (Contributor Reference)

To re-implement or apply a similar caching strategy to another endpoint, a contributor would follow these steps:

1.  **Identify Target Endpoint:** Pinpoint the specific `router.get` or `router.post` handler in `apps/api/src/routes/*.ts` that processes frequently accessed, read-heavy data.
2.  **Import Redis Client:** Ensure the `redisClient` is imported at the top of the route file:
    ```typescript
    import { redisClient } from "../utils/redis";
    ```
3.  **Define Cache Key Parameters:** Determine which request parameters (e.g., `id`, `userId`, `lat`, `lng`, `query`) are essential for uniquely identifying the data being requested. For geographical queries, consider rounding numerical parameters (like `lat`, `lng`) to a suitable precision using `toFixed(N)` to optimize cache hit rates.
4.  **Construct Cache Key:** Create a consistent and descriptive cache key string using template literals:
    ```typescript
    const param1 = req.query.param1 as string;
    const param2 = parseFloat(req.query.param2 as string).toFixed(3); // Example rounding
    const cacheKey = `your_service:your_endpoint:${param1}:${param2}`;
    ```
5.  **Implement Cache Read Logic:** Insert a `try...catch` block at the very beginning of the endpoint's logic, before any database calls:
    ```typescript
    try {
        if (redisClient.isOpen) {
            const cachedData = await redisClient.get(cacheKey);
            if (cachedData) {
                return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedData));
            }
        }
    } catch (error) {
        logger.warn("Redis cache read failed for [your_endpoint]", { error });
        // Continue to database query if cache read fails
    }
    ```
6.  **Implement Data Fetching and Formatting:** Proceed with the existing or new logic to fetch data from the primary source (e.g., Supabase, another API) and format it into the desired response structure.
7.  **Implement Cache Write Logic:** After successfully fetching and formatting the `responseData`, add another `try...catch` block before sending the response:
    ```typescript
    const responseData = { /* your formatted data */ };

    try {
        if (redisClient.isOpen) {
            // Set an appropriate TTL (Time-To-Live) in seconds
            await redisClient.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(responseData), { EX: 3600 });
        }
    } catch (error) {
        logger.warn("Redis cache write failed for [your_endpoint]", { error });
        // Continue to send response even if cache write fails
    }

    return res.json(responseData);
    ```
8.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Ensure `logger.warn` is used for Redis-related errors to provide visibility into caching issues without disrupting user experience.
9.  **Dependencies:** Verify that the `redis` library is installed and configured correctly in the `apps/api` project, and that `redisClient` is properly initialized and exported from `../utils/redis`.

## Impact on System Architecture

This change significantly impacts our backend architecture by introducing Redis as a critical caching layer for performance-sensitive endpoints.

1.  **Performance Enhancement:** The most immediate impact is a substantial reduction in response times for the `/api/pharmacies/nearest` endpoint, especially for repeated queries of the same geographical areas. This directly improves the user experience by making the platform feel faster and more responsive.
2.  **Reduced Database Load:** By serving a significant portion of requests from Redis, we dramatically decrease the query load on our Supabase database. This frees up database resources for other operations, improves overall database health, and reduces the risk of performance degradation during peak usage.
3.  **Improved Scalability:** The caching layer allows our API to handle a much higher volume of requests for nearest pharmacies without requiring proportional scaling of our database resources. This is crucial for SahiDawa's growth as we expand to more rural areas and user bases.
4.  **Increased Resilience (with graceful degradation):** While introducing a new dependency (Redis), the implementation includes robust error handling that ensures the system remains operational even if Redis becomes unavailable. This design choice prevents a single point of failure from impacting core functionality.
5.  **Foundation for Future Caching:** This PR establishes a clear pattern and integrates the necessary tooling (`redisClient`) for implementing caching on other read-heavy or computationally intensive endpoints across the SahiDawa platform. This sets a precedent for optimizing other parts of our API.
6.  **Operational Overhead:** We now have an additional service (Redis) to monitor, maintain, and potentially scale. This adds a small amount of operational complexity to our infrastructure.

## Testing & Verification

Verification of this change involved several key steps:

1.  **Type Checking:** We confirmed that the codebase remained type-safe by running `npm run type-check` (or `npx tsc --noEmit`), ensuring no new type errors were introduced by the Redis integration or type imports.
2.  **Functional Endpoint Testing:** The `/api/pharmacies/nearest` endpoint was tested to ensure it continued to return correct pharmacy data under normal operating conditions, both with and without Redis actively caching.
3.  **Redis Cache Hit Verification:**
    *   Initial requests for a specific `lat`, `lng`, and `radius` were observed to trigger a database query and subsequently write data to Redis.
    *   Subsequent requests with the exact same parameters were then verified to retrieve data directly from the Redis cache, bypassing the database. This was typically confirmed by monitoring network requests, response times, and potentially inspecting Redis keys directly.
4.  **Cache Expiration Testing:** While not explicitly detailed in the PR, implicit testing would involve verifying that requests made after the 3600-second TTL would result in a cache miss, a database query, and a subsequent cache write, ensuring data freshness.
5.  **Graceful Degradation Testing (Implied):** The presence of `try...catch` blocks around Redis operations suggests that testing for scenarios where Redis is unavailable or encounters errors would have been performed to ensure the API correctly falls back to database queries without crashing.
6.  **Edge Cases:**
    *   Requests with valid but unique `lat/lng/radius` combinations (expected cache miss, then write).
    *   Requests where no pharmacies are found (expected to cache an empty array).
    *   Requests with invalid input parameters (handled by existing Zod validation, not directly impacted by caching logic).
